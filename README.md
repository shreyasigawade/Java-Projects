This repository contains three **Java-based mini projects** I built during college, focusing on **OOP, JDBC, and data structures**.

## 📌 Projects Included:
1️⃣ **Hotel Management System** (`src` folder) – A console-based system for managing hotel guests and rooms.  
2️⃣ **Array Project** – Demonstrates Java arrays, sorting, searching, and basic CRUD operations.  
3️⃣ **University Management System** – A simple student management system using **OOP principles**.
